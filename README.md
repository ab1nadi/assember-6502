## assembler-6502
A basic assembler for the 6502 processor. I eventually plan to use this with my 6502 emulator. 
Has built in syntax analysis, for easy detection of  labels, directives, opcodes, or operands 
that don't exist or aren't implented. Doesn't do semantic analysis it is only an assembler after all.
